Traditional and cultures were invented by us, so as all the evil deeds we have done in the past centuries. PETA is not American but it's an organisation with people from different parts of the world. PETA shares the same ancient principle &quot;Ahimsa&quot;, which Indians today have forgotten and ignored."

Do not interfere in a traditional practice in the name of law which has never been stable for the past thousands of years! Do a research on the loops in laws where people are using those loops to escape from the crime that they have commited! Apply these laws in something which is really important rather than applying it in unnecessary things! Vaalghe Tamil Nadu! Vaalghe India! Jai Hind!!!!!
23,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA29_21sjvk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA29_21sjvk,"Your comment is baseless. I study in London,LSE (from Chennai).<br>I have seen this sport several times and the people who owns this bulls. This people don't torment the animals rather they build the bull by providing them the best and healthy food, I would compare it with owning a Racing Motor sport Crew.They give best of everything as they want there bull to win. Well the difference is Motor Sport is owned by Billionaires . But , This people who owns this bulls struggle for a meal a day, But they make sure the bull gets best of every thing. The bull is like a brother to them its Family.( How would you expect them to be cruel to there own family ?). Well about the sport it not like  100 people are gonna jump on the cow rather Its only one person has to Hug the bull For 15 Meters which bull wins is the best bull so its the highest paid bread . This sport has been for more than 3000 years you can not Ban a sport rather regulate it, Well It already under control by the state government, Its Governed by IAS. Speaking of culture up here in London If you buy a house your not allowed to Paint are modify the exterior of your own house, Its because they want to be conservative about there culture, In a city Like London who are developed and modern they spent a lot to stay conservative, why not a country like India? We are running towards Modern culture Which is good,But that doesn't mean we have to forget Who we are. <br>Well, I will put this in a simpler way There is huge Business behind this Ban. India is Number 1 in Diary farming, What if companies take over this business. We are buying Milk for 50 Rupees now, If its take over by Corporate They would sell it for 200 Rupees. In this case What if all the bulls are dead eventually the cows will die as well.<br>So corporates will show up giving us  Diary products for much higher price. <br>So think about it. Its about our country.<br><br>Regards <br>SharanRaj"
24,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA29_21sjvk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA29_21sjvk,Regulation in India?  As if there is not enough corruption?  Either make it totally legal or ban it. <br>And why biriyani and automobile accidents are thrown into this issue?  In what way one bad thing justifies the other?  The issue is purely on animal cruelty and any discussions and solutions should be based on that only.  Everything is relative as the word &quot;humane&quot; is up to the interpretation of the people.

There is an international network behind this problem to bring the milk industry across  the globe in the hands of 13 families (western) who have the a2 type milk patent which can be. produced only by native breeds not by jersey cows.This network wants to destroy our native breeds (already done in lot of states in our country).Pl bring awareness to all fellows in INDIA and read lot about a1 and a2 milk,what type of milk w r drinking (thats not milk at all.only20-30%is milk, that too a1 milk which gives lot deseases which promotes the parmacitical companies around world)and wat will our generation drink???this is not a problem of jallikattu.this is for our land ,agriculture ,healthy living,identity  and so on."

Its possbile to oppose this everywhere. But if someone opposes one  while supports other, then they are pushing their agenda, not animal rights. PETA is NOT that, i assure u.<br>Third, struggle in every country depends on how open and free that country is. PETA has maximum demonstrations in US <b>because</b> it is free country which allows protest. So is India. It doesn't mean India is most cruel place for animals. If you say , why don't PETA protest against bakrid in Saudi arabia, that's simply not possible. Not because PETA supports it, but cuz that country has no freedom at all.  Or people may threaten violence against protestors in name of culture etc. We should be thankful that doesnt happen in India (till now)."

93,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA29_21sjvk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA29_21sjvk,"My Humble Request to all Protesters/Leaders of Jallikattu Movement:<br><br>Vanakkam! I admire everybody for coming forward to protect and cherish this ancient Indian tradition of Jallikattu(Bull Hugging/Stopping/Sorting). Many thanks to India‚Äôs News media for coverage of this movement. It helps ordinary people like us understand and empathize/feel connected to brave Tamil Youth who are eager with passion and valor like Jallikattu bulls. I am glad India‚Äôs Central Government, Tamil Nadu State Government and all Political Parties are in support of JalliKattu. I am happy that even celebrities and business people of TN, AP, Telangana are also in support of Jallikattu. <br><br>I apologize in advance for expressing anything inconvenient, incorrect and wrong due to limitations in my time and my understanding. I am not a UNO Expert, IFS/IAS/IPS guru, lawyer, police, politician, judge, researcher, defense strategist, JNU professor, PITAnewala, or a media professional... I beg audience/readers too submit their comments and utilize various Social media on how to best resolve these types of injustices/oppression/ridicule/discrimination standing by your side to maintain peace in Jallikattu movement.<br><br>Now that the protests are turning violent causing injuries to people and destruction/burning of private and public vehicles, I humbly request/beg everybody to please kindly restrain their frustrations/anger and not vandalize others‚Äô properties & vehicles (private/public, that are expensive and needed for common people)). Imagine you were at a festive gathering and a fight broke out between family members...everyone at the gathering are watching. Doesn't it generate awkward feelings? Then how much more damage these damages (of people/police & properties) could cause to the reputation/respect of Tamil Nadu and India among comity of nations? As a match-stick sets forest trees on fire and char them and those amongst them and around them, I urge everyone(including yourself) not to be frustrated, to be humble, compassionate yet cautious, wise and impartial in their judgments. <br><br>May be its time to take rest and revisit this movement when the need arises. I understand that Jallikattu is an age-old tradition to sort Indian-born bulls with best gene pool, best milk and preserve them too and not just a sport. Wonder why not use modern veterinarian techniques to do the same? In my view, may be the stayed order could be lifted with rules and regulations. And Criminal charges be levied on only those people who are abusing bulls just like Justice is served against only those men who abuse women. Banning Jallikattu in India is like banning marriage because some spouses beat/abuse/kill their wives (and husbands).<br><br>Sometimes we tend to think the members of our communities, religions, castes, tribes, languages, gender (including LGBT), towns, states, countries etc. are like us. Like us, they have same principles, ethics and morals. However for most of the time, for Indian borns, it looks like not the case. For instance, most of the time, I trust all Indians share their burdens, problems and discuss/consult each other. However, when incidents (violent protests/vandalism) like these happen, my trust, unity, empathy and compassion towards fellow Indians wears down. If you have as much faith in Murugan/Your Gods & Goddesses/Allah as I much as I do, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll agree with me at least before him/her. Therefore, may be its time to take rest and revisit this movement when the need arises.<br><br>And I tell you the truth, I eat cattle flesh (cooked of course) with same sacrosanctity and respect as those who eat the flesh of Jesus Christ every weekend (communion) at a Church‚Ä¶‚Ä¶And keep praising God for making me so superior to those bovines I eat! I keep praising God for making those who eat them superior to Indians in wealth, power, technologies, weapons and luxuries. I also praise God for blessing the beef eaters that just 8 of them hold half of the world‚Äôs wealth. I also praise God for blessing those beef eaters not only in Hollywood but also in Hindi Film Industry‚Ä¶I also praise God for how lucky they are all that they get to shake hands with Hon‚Äôble elected representatives of India (MPs & MLAs) including Hon‚Äôble PM of India‚Ä¶..and when those beef-eaters die, everyone including Hon‚Äôble PM of India stands up and pays respects including standing silent for few minutes in public conferences. THEREFORE, LET ME GIVE CONFIDENCE TO EVERYBODY THAT I AM NOT WORRIED ABOUT BOVINES, I AM ONLY WORRIED ABOUT MY POOR TAMIL BROTHERS GETTING INJURED, SUFFERING LIFE-LONG TRAUMA AND WORSE DEAD DUE TO THIS EXTREME SPORT OF BULL HUGGING/STOPPING!<br><br>Personally I think the main reason for popularity of JalliKattu sport in Tamil Nadu may be due to poverty of Tamil Youth so much so that they are not able to buy expensive equipments required for similar bull sports (of USA/Spain/Portugal/Australia/France/Canada/South America etc.) or Olympic sports or any other extreme adventurous sports like those in Developed nations (USA, France, Europe, UK, Japan, South Korea, Japan etc.) (Mother State of Sri Sundar Pichaiji, the CEO of Google! Wonder what he is doing for youth of his Home State besides his own children regarding sports?)<br><br>Not depending on anybody(billionaire, celebrity or politician), let us all pray together and wish that in Tamil Nadu there are also more sports competitions like Wrestling, Judo, Swimming, throws etc. and many more that are all adventurous/manly/extreme. Then the state players could as well be sent to compete at National level and at international levels. And some news mentioned Kungfu/karate, fencing/sword-fights originated in Tamil Nadu‚Ä¶.How about sports like that?<br><br>That said I am not affiliated with any political party, any religion, caste, last name, race, tribe, language, region, nationality, gender (women including LGBT) etc.<br><br>I beg all privileged (including you) travel around India and the world. I wish they not only enjoy their trips & take pictures/videos and ‚Äúexperience foods, nature, imaraten/buildings, shopping foreign mall, finding/giving/getting spouses, honey-moon, enjoying music, wine, dance, night-life, and cultures‚Äù but also advise/teach their fellow human-beings their experiences/wisdom (old & new) for progress, peace, harmony and prosperity of not only the entire world but also of India. (Given a chance, like you, they are also keen, highly adaptive and always refine themselves!)<br><br>We are able to watch the news and write comments/replies here though we live few thousand miles away in different time-zones because we all have high-speed internet connection. What about those in TN (India) who do not have electricity and internet and whose voices are not heard like theirs and ours? (Especially those living in small towns and villages?) Hence let us accelerate on ‚Äòwar footing‚Äô two most important infrastructure projects, Electricity and Internet proliferation to mitigate ignorance and reduce ‚Äòinformation gap‚Äô strengthening ties between all ‚Äúhuman beings‚Äù(Manavatha Vadi/Insaaniyat) on earth and make the world one big global village (Vasudaiva Kutumbakam).<br><br>The modern India(world) is faced with many grave challenges like poverty, malnutrition, pollution, corruption, dirty politics, mental diseases, extortions, riots, suicides, parasitic economies, prostitutes/concubines & their cuckolding, religiously-enforced-no-choice pregnancies, teen-pregnancies/marriages, divorces, gender inequalities(including LGBT), misguided proselytizations/religious terrorism, human trafficking, visa slavery, adverse climate changes and Global warming. Let us all humbly meditate and introspect <br><br>‚ÄúDo we, even now in 21st century, fight amongst ourselves and try tearing our Mother India apart and watch vultures devouring it or we now vow to stitch her wounds, nurture her, heal and strengthen her to stand up for Peace once again and shine, brighter than ever, as the Beacon of Hope for jobless, sick, vanchith, peedith, Sochith,kuchilith, dabhe, divyang jan, naree and upaekshith around the world?‚Äù<br><br>JAI JAWAN! JAI KISAN! JAI VIGYAN! JAAGO NOWJAWAN!<br>STANDUP INDIA! STARTUP INDIA!<br><br>Once again, please kindly forgive me if I said anything incorrect and wrong or hurt anyone‚Äôs feelings! I am not an expert or respected but only a common Indian citizen (a looser begging for Justice and Unity). Also due to time constraints, please kindly forgive my Indlish mistakes too! I will correct my Indlish mistakes as time permits!<br><br>Satyameva Jayathe!<br>Kal Gandikota<br>Note: I am not paid to comment and not seeking favors.
